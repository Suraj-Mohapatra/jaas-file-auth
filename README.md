# jaas-file-auth  

JAAS is a bullshit authentication framework.  
no need to learn this, no need to use this repo, this repo is dead right after its birth.  
go learn JASPIC + JACC or their Jakarta alternatives ( Jakarta Authenticaton & Jakarta Authorization ).  
go learn Jakarta Security  
go learn Spring Security -- most recommended
